# APIMatic Schema Libary for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides utilities for creating schema for different types, along with serialization information.

These schema can later be used to:

1. Validate data against schema.
2. Prepare data for serialization to JSON or XML.
3. Convert deserialized JSON or XML data to the schema type.
3. Provide strong-typing in TypeScript for untrusted/untyped data.
